# [Dimensionality Reduction - case of macro ingredients of pizzas](https://github.com/askovr0n/Pizza-PCA-TSNE-R-ENG)

- The dataset contains measurements that capture the kind of things that make a pizza tasty
- The work uses unsupervised learning method based on dimensionality reduction: PCA and T-SNE
- Kaiser criterion was used in order to improve "reduction quality"
- PCA algorithm found that 3 components were sufficient to gather some information about the macronutrients of the pizzas
- In the case of T-SNE, some difficulty was found with the interpretation of the results. This is most likely due to a too small data set
- R software was used for data mining, engineering and modelling. Additionaly, the paper has been published on the [Rpubs website](https://rpubs.com/askovron/pca-tsne-pizza)
